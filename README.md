# CloudVault

CloudVault aims to provide a unified tool for synchronizing files across
multiple cloud storage providers. The project starts with a minimal CLI that
supports one-way synchronization from a local directory to Google Drive and is
planned to evolve into a multi-cloud, bidirectional solution with a web-based
management interface.

For details about the architecture and planned phases, see
[docs/design.md](docs/design.md).
